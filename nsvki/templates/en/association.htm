            <p class='text-justify'> The NSVKI is the cooperation for
                Study Associations for Artificial Intelligence in the
                Netherlands.  The members VIA (Amsterdam), STORM (Amsterdam),
                Cover (Groningen), CognAC (Nijmegen) and USCKI Incognito
                (Utrecht) decided it to be a good idea to keep in contact in
                this form.  Our aim is to support Dutch AI students, and foster
                ties between students in all of the Netherlands. </p>
